        <p>Hi-Fructose was founded by two artists by the name of Attaboy and Annie Owen in the year 2005. It is a magazine that is published quarterly. The art blog part is headed by Andy Smith. Hi-Fructose revolves around contemporary art and showcases the best artists of recent times. There is no fixed genre that it emphasizes. Each post highlights the works of a different artist, focusing on one notable work. A typical Hi-Fructose post also describes how the artist came up with the idea and the process behind the creation of the work. The post contains information about the artist and his/her quotes. Hi-Fructose appreciates and celebrates original artwork and inspires new artists to come up with better works. The blog is full of talented contributors and readers can expect as many as four posts every day!</p>
